     * This function is used to fetch nearby places from the Google Places API.

     *
     * The function parameters are annotated with @Query. This means they will be added to the URL as query parameters.
     * For example, if apiKey is "abc", location is "1.0,2.0", radiusInMeters is 1000, and placeType is "restaurant",
     * the full URL will be "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/nearbysearch/json?key=abc&location=1.0,2.0&radius=1000&type=restaurant".
     *
     * @param apiKey The API key to authenticate the request.
     * @param location The latitude and longitude around which to retrieve place information. This must be specified as latitude,longitude.
     * @param radiusInMeters Defines the distance (in meters) within which to bias place results. The maximum allowed radius is 50â€‰000 meters.
     * @param placeType Restricts the results to places matching the specified type.
     * @return A Call object which can be used to send the request.
